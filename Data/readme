Three datasets are needed for this analysis. 

The first two datasets needed are Maylistings_short.csv which you can find in this datafolder, and the second is Mayreviews.csv. 
This dataset was too large to upload but can be found on insideairbnb.com or at the following link: 
http://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/on/toronto/2020-05-07/visualisations/listings.csv

Listings and Reivews dataset will be run at the top of the code. 

Third dataset: 
DFclean_sentiment.csv 

This will be run later into the code at the Sentiment Classification Machine Learning Algorithms Section.
