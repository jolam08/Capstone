In the code folder, I have included three .rmd files. The following is an explanation of each file and order of which to execute. 

Exploratory Code: This file contains exploratory data on both the maylistings.csv and mayreviews.csv. Variables are also preprocessed in this code (handling of missing data and outliers), and a final clean dataset is written. 

Sentiment Code: This file contains sentiment analysis of the comments section of Mayreviews.csv. Exploratory data using unigram, bigram,  and tf-idf is performed. Lastly, sentiment analysis using 4 lexicon dictionaries are performed to obtain a "positive" or "negative" of each listing. 

Classification Code: This file contains machine learning algorithms on sentiment classification. The ML models used are: Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
